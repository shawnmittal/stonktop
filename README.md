# StonkTop
Python based terminal user interface (TUI) for tracking stocks inspired by [cointop](https://github.com/miguelmota/cointop).

The project is built using (urwid)[https://github.com/urwid/urwid] a CUI library for Python. 

Data structures heavily lifted from (stui)[https://github.com/mil-ad/stui], a Slurm dashboard for the terminal.
